# rail-camera

What do you do when a proprietary 3d printer won't let you use the camera without their special cloud? 

you build your own robotic camera! 

this project is being developed for the chesterfield county library makerspace to monitor their printers from anywhere in the building while
bypassing the locked down printer firmware.
